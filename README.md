Using a given number, presumed from a company already owning a commercial company phone, give    
possible number-letter combinations for the company.   
This is very beneficial for many companies, as the "catchier" a phone number is, the more   
memorable it is. 
Using a 'database', a coding language of our choice, an interface, and the use of black-   
box testing, make a program that gives the most relevant phone combination for a company.
