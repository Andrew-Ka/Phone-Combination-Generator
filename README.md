Using a given number, presumed from a company already owning a commercial company phone, give    
possible number-letter combinations for the company.   
This is very beneficial for many companies, as the "catchier" a phone number is, the more   
memorable it is. 
Using a 'database', a coding language of our choice, an interface, and the use of black-   
box testing, make a program that gives the most relevant phone combination for a company.   


### Basic Overview:
All diagrams can be found in the Diagrams folder.     
This project aims to design and implement a software solution that finds several English words that best represent a company, given a phone number. For instance, 409-880-7011 could correspond to any word from the cartesian product {g, h, i} ⨯ {} ⨯ {w, x, y, z} ⨯ {t, u, v} ⨯ {t, u, v} ⨯ {} ⨯ {p, q, r, s} ⨯ {_} ⨯ {/, ., @} ⨯ {/, ., @}.

### Features:

- Interactive UI
- Result Storage
- Extensive Database
- Optimized Optional Databases

### Technologies Used: 

- Implemented using Java
- UI implemented using JavaFx

### Getting Started:

To get started with our project MergeFX, please follow these steps:

#### Installation

- Clone the project from the GitHub repository
- Install Java and any necessary dependencies

#### Usage

- Run the application using your preferred Java IDE or through the command line
- Follow the menu-driven interface to enter a phone number and generate the most relevant representation of the number
- If System Administration is chosen, all possible combinations will be saved in the project folder 

#### Documentation

- The project includes a use-case diagram, class diagram, interaction diagram, state chart, and activity diagram to help understand its design and functionality.
- Any assumptions or limitations made while developing the models are documented in the report.
- Black-box testing has been performed to ensure the software is functioning as expected

#### Data Persistence

Data Persistence has been done through the use of the System Administration option, though limitations are discussed in the project report.
